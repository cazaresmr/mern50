        <h3>Day 1: Introduction to the MERN Stack</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to the world of web development where innovation and
          efficiency converge! Today, let's embark on an exciting journey to
          explore the MERN stack, a powerful combination of technologies that is
          transforming the way we build modern web applications. Whether you're
          a seasoned developer or just starting, understanding the MERN stack
          can open doors to creating dynamic, full-featured web applications
          with ease.
        </p>
        <h4>What is the MERN Stack?</h4>
        <p>
          The MERN stack is a collection of technologies used for developing web
          applications. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
          Each of these components plays a crucial role in the stack:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>MongoDB</strong>: A NoSQL database that uses JSON-like
            documents with optional schemas. It is designed to handle large
            amounts of data and scale horizontally. MongoDB is known for its
            flexibility and scalability, making it an ideal choice for modern
            web applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Express.js</strong>: A minimal and flexible Node.js web
            application framework that provides a robust set of features for web
            and mobile applications. Express.js is designed to make building web
            applications and APIs easier by providing a simple interface to
            handle HTTP requests and responses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>React</strong>: A JavaScript library for building user
            interfaces, developed by Facebook. React allows developers to create
            large web applications that can change data without reloading the
            page. Its component-based architecture and virtual DOM make it
            highly efficient and easy to work with.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Node.js</strong>: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8
            JavaScript engine. Node.js allows developers to run JavaScript on
            the server side, enabling the creation of dynamic and scalable
            network applications. It is known for its non-blocking, event-driven
            architecture, which makes it lightweight and efficient.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>The Power of the MERN Stack</h4>
        <p>
          The MERN stack leverages the power of JavaScript across all its
          components, from the client-side React code to the server-side Node.js
          and Express.js code, and even to the database queries with MongoDB.
          This unification under a single language streamlines the development
          process, making it easier for developers to switch between different
          parts of the stack.
        </p>
        <h5>MongoDB: The Flexible Database</h5>
        <p>
          MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that is designed to
          store and retrieve large amounts of data. Unlike traditional
          relational databases, MongoDB uses a flexible schema model, allowing
          developers to store data in JSON-like documents. This flexibility is
          particularly beneficial for modern web applications that require rapid
          iterations and changes in data structures.
        </p>
        <p>Key Features of MongoDB:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Schema-less Data Models</strong>: MongoDB's flexible data
            model allows for dynamic changes to the data structure without the
            need for a predefined schema.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scalability</strong>: MongoDB can handle large amounts of
            data and scale horizontally by adding more servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>High Performance</strong>: Optimized for read and write
            performance, making it ideal for high-traffic applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Aggregation Framework</strong>: Allows for complex data
            processing and transformation within the database.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Express.js: The Efficient Web Framework</h5>
        <p>
          Express.js is a fast and minimal web framework for Node.js that
          simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs. It
          provides a set of robust features for handling HTTP requests,
          middleware, and routing, making it a popular choice for server-side
          development.
        </p>
        <p>Key Features of Express.js:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Middleware</strong>: Express.js uses middleware functions to
            handle HTTP requests and responses, allowing for modular and
            reusable code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Routing</strong>: Provides a simple and flexible routing
            mechanism for defining application routes and handling requests.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Integration</strong>: Easily integrates with various
            template engines, databases, and other tools to build full-featured
            web applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Minimalistic</strong>: Focuses on simplicity and
            performance, providing only the core functionalities needed to build
            web applications.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>React: The Dynamic UI Library</h5>
        <p>
          React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
          It allows developers to create reusable UI components that manage
          their own state, leading to efficient and maintainable code. React's
          virtual DOM and component-based architecture make it an ideal choice
          for building dynamic and responsive web applications.
        </p>
        <p>Key Features of React:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Component-Based Architecture</strong>: Encourages the
            creation of reusable and independent UI components.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Virtual DOM</strong>: Optimizes updates by only re-rendering
            the components that have changed, leading to improved performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Declarative</strong>: Allows developers to describe the UI
            in a declarative manner, making the code more predictable and easier
            to debug.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ecosystem</strong>: A rich ecosystem of tools and libraries,
            including React Router for routing and Redux for state management.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Node.js: The Versatile Runtime</h5>
        <p>
          Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run
          JavaScript on the server side. Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine,
          Node.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it
          lightweight and efficient. This makes Node.js an excellent choice for
          building scalable network applications.
        </p>
        <p>Key Features of Node.js:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Event-Driven Architecture</strong>: Utilizes an
            event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, allowing for the handling of
            multiple connections simultaneously.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>JavaScript Everywhere</strong>: Enables the use of
            JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development,
            unifying the development process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rich Ecosystem</strong>: A vast ecosystem of modules and
            libraries available through npm (Node Package Manager).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance</strong>: High performance and scalability,
            making it suitable for real-time applications such as chat
            applications and online gaming.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <li>
            <strong>Set Up the Server</strong>: Create an
            <code>index.js</code> file and set up a basic Express server.
            <pre><code>const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;

// Middleware
app.use(express.json());

// MongoDB Connection
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});

// Routes
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
